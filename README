This is a simple utility to use the new FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE mechanism for
fallocate().  It was written as a quick and simple demonstration of when you
might want to quickly scan memory for zeros (although it probably won't matter
here for practical reasons, as the backing filesystem is almost certainly going
to be your bottleneck) to accomany a blog post.  It's pretty self-explanatory.
